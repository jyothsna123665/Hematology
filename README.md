# Hematology Type Detection Via Patterns
-Hematology type detection is a critical process in various medical applications,including blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and emergency medicine.Traditional blood typing methods involve the use of serological testing, which can be timeconsuming and require blood samples.
-Hematology type detection via ridge patterns refers to the identification of an individual's blood group through the analysis of fingerprint ridge patterns.
-It is an innovative and non-invasive approach that combines biometric technology with medical information. Fingerprints are unique to each individual, with distinct patterns formed by ridges and furrows on the skinâ€™s surface. 
-Studies have shown that certain biometric features, including fingerprint patterns, may be associated with genetic traits, such as blood groups.
-This project enhances the fingerprint image and extracts the relevant features.It applies deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)--VGG16 to analyze the extracted features and identify the blood group of the person.
